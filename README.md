# Hackage Trustee Issue Tracking

This is an issue tracker for coordinating Hackage maintainance and trustee operations **for packages hosted** on [Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org) that may require intervention by [Hackage trustees](https://hackage.haskell.org/packages/trustees/).

Please make sure you've made an effort to contact the upstream maintainer for a package needing attention before filing issues here. See also the [issue filing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for what to include in the issue report.

The process for trustee operations is described in detail in [the policy document](https://github.com/haskell-infra/hackage-trustees/blob/master/policy.md).

For bugs and issues in the **software component `hackage-server`** please go to https://github.com/haskell/hackage-server instead.

The trustees can also be contacted at [trustees@hackage.haskell.org](mailto:trustees@hackage.haskell.org)
